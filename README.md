what does this project do?
this project is made to detect lane in the road its a prototype of the vehicle system that works through AI.I mean without human driver.

you guys can run this code in your system by saving the both video and the code main.py in the same folder and running it in vs code.
you guys can also test it with other videos but you guys need to keep the video in the same folder as the code is in and the video's name should be"test_video.mp4" or that won't work if you guys want to give it your own name then you need to edit the code to accept other name of video as input
